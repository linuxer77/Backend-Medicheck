# Medicheck - Backend

## Overview

This is the backend service for the Medicheck Diagnosis Platform. It provides REST API endpoints for handling various media types, blockchain integration for medical records, and IPFS storage capabilities.

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Django with Django REST Framework
- **Database**: SQLite (db.sqlite3)
- **Storage**: IPFS integration for decentralized file storage
- **Blockchain**: Web3 integration with Ethereum (SimpleBackendRegistry contract)

## Core Components

### API Module

- **Serializers**: Handles data serialization for various media types (Text, Image, Audio, Video, PDF)
- **Views**: API endpoints for frontend communication
- **Services**: Business logic implementation
- **Web3**: Blockchain integration services

### Models

The backend supports multiple media types:

- Text documents
- Images
- Video files
- PDF reports

## Key Endpoints

- **/pdf**: Accepts PDF reports from the frontend for IPFS/Blockchain storage
- Transaction verification endpoints for blockchain data retrieval

## Features

- **Media Processing**: Handles various media formats for medical diagnostics
- **Blockchain Integration**: Secures medical reports using smart contracts
- **IPFS Storage**: Decentralized storage for medical documents
- **Transaction Verification**: Validate blockchain transactions for authenticity
- **Error Handling**: Robust error management for network and processing issues

## Development Setup

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run migrations:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

3. Start development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

## API Integration

The backend provides integration points for the following frontend features:

- PDF report generation and storage
- Blockchain transaction verification
- Media file processing for diagnostic tools

## Security Considerations

- Implements encryption for sensitive medical data
- Uses blockchain technology for immutable record-keeping
- Generates verification IDs for patient records
